# traffic-light-controller
This is the code for a traffic light controller, simulated in proteus. 
Both traffic lights are on opposite sides of the road, each traffic light has green, yellow and red. When a vehicle approaches any side. The lights on the opposite side would change from green to yellow and then to red, after the traffic on that side has subsided. A specific delay is given to allow traffic on the opposite side to subside.
